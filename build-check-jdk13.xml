<!--
   This script compiles using JDK 1.3 all classes except those that
   use JDK 1.4 features.

   Commons IO should be built as normal using the maven build and
   JDK 1.4 or higher. This script should be run before a release to
   check that the majority of Commons IO is still JDK 1.3 compatible.

   Switch the default JDK to 1.3 and then run this script
   (using "ant -f build-check-jdk13.xml") - it will fail if the JDK
    version is not 1.3 or any of the classes use features from a later
   JDK version.
